# Azure Cloud & Infrastructure Engineer

I help practitioners build real debugging instincts by fixing **repo-based Azure/Terraform incident labs** — not reading tutorials.

Every Monday, I publish a **simulated production-style ticket + broken repo**.  
You clone it, deploy it, investigate the failure, ship a fix, then compare your approach with mine (and the community).

**Focus:** Azure • Terraform • Networking • Incident Response

---

## Follow for

- **Weekly hands-on incident labs** (Azure, Terraform, networking, DR, IaC guardrails)
- **Practical post-mortems:** what broke, how we proved it, and how to prevent repeats
- **IaC patterns:** static analysis, least privilege, blast-radius containment
- **How AI can support infra workflows safely** (without replacing engineering judgment)

---

## What you’ll practice

- **Networking:** routing, DNS, NSGs, hub/spoke, private endpoints
- **IAM:** RBAC, least privilege, break-glass patterns
- **Resilience:** DR, failover, blast radius control
- **Operational rigour:** logs, diffs, change discipline, verification
- **Governance:** policy-as-code, CI guardrails, drift control
- **Cost awareness:** spending signals + pragmatic trade-offs
