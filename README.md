# Lee Moss — Azure/Terraform Incident Labs

Azure Infrastructure Engineer at UK Home Office | IaC & DevOps

I publish **repo-based incident labs** so you can sharpen real debugging instincts by spotting and fixing realistic Azure/Terraform misconfigurations — not just reading tutorials.

**Weekly loop:**  
Production-style ticket → intentionally broken repo → clone → investigate → identify gaps → fix → compare with my walkthrough.

No deployment required — simply run the Python HCL2 guardrail script to validate and surface unmet conditions.

### Start Here

### What You'll Practice
- Detecting & remediating networking misconfigurations (DNS, routes, NSGs, private endpoints, hub/spoke)
- Enforcing IAM controls (RBAC, least privilege, break-glass patterns)
- Validating DR/failover readiness + blast-radius limits
- Strengthening IaC guardrails (linting, policy checks, “plan isn’t proof”)
- Identifying Kubernetes (AKS) compliance & security gaps
- Operational rigour: logs, diffs, verification, change discipline
- Governance: policy-as-code, CI guardrails, drift detection
- Cost awareness: spending signals + pragmatic trade-offs
